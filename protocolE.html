    <h1>Protocol E</h1>
</head>

<body>
    <p>All the guidelines in Protocol B are generally applicable to this situation too.</p>
    <ul>

        <li>De-escalation of harassment and brigading: A person with a large follower base has to consider potential benefits and consequences of weighing in responsibly and their choice needs to be respected. Resolution and accountability processes rarely benefit from large numbers of uninvolved people jumping in. To this end if a person has come to be harassed, critique may have to wait until after the situation has been resolved in order to not provoke further harassment. To this end, as a person with a large audience don’t ‘punch down’ with your content unless you’re willing to have the results on your conscience, and face accountability for harm it may cause.</li>

        <li>A response to a given conflict should not be demanded from anyone. If you think that a third party should weigh in that is your right, but they may feel too unqualified to speak on such a conflict, have unknown triggers, or feel unsafe to talk about it in a given setting for whatever reason. Don’t make content attempting to coerce that person into involving themself.</li>


        <li>If someone is caught up in the conflict and then chooses to stop, it does not then permit you to harass them in private conversations. One may choose to stop participating because it is negatively affecting their health or the events being discussed may be too triggering for them to continue. Don’t take a change in involvement as a reason to guilt them in the content you make.</li>


        <li>Even if you’re not directly involved in the matter, don’t mention it on social media, videos, or livestreams. Avoid mentioning there is a concerning situation if at all possible, but if you consent after being pressured, or to prevent hearsay or victim blaming, only mention that an internal discussion with several parties is ongoing. Do not engage further, and do not use stress as a reason to produce content that may escalate a situation.</li>


        <li>People reaching out for your opinion are doing so in good faith. Don’t lash out, please realize that these most of these people aren’t attacking you, and aren’t reaching out to you just for attention. If people begin to harass you, don’t directly engage them because you may inadvertently send some of the people who see your content to harass them. It may feel like you are letting yourself get walked all over, but you are responsible for your platform and the harm it may cause.</li>
    </ul>
