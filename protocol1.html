    <h1>Protocol One - If you or someone you know wants to make a claim</h1>
</head>

<body>
    <p>The guidelines in Protocol X are generally applicable to this situation too.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Prioritise your own healing. Traumatic events can leave you feeling as though your own well-being is not important. Try to remember that you are worthy of support even if you are struggling to find it. Think about what you need to heal. Before anything else seek help for your trauma. Some resources can be found here.</li>

        <li>Consider using a confidante: the accountability process is inherently emotional and often painful. Finding a person or a pod who you can give your full experience to, work with, and vent to (especially for unhelpful or invective feelings) will help the community by preventing harm from spreading, and can help you greatly in sorting out what you want from this process.</li>
        <ul>
            <li>On selecting confidantes:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Make sure your confidantes believe you on your account, or at least exhibit full trust in it, and understand what you want out of the process.</li>
                <li>Make sure that they know they are a confidante according to the protocol so that they understand what being your confidante means.</li>
                <li>Make sure that the confidantes that you do choose are willing to stick with you through the process so they can tell you as early as possible if they can’t commit.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>

        <li>If you decide to make your claim public and have trouble coming forward on your own or are not sure of your ability to express what happened to you clearly, ask help from a mediator or confidantes. Do not face your abuser alone, regardless of your choice.</li>


        <li>Make the claim directly to the person or with a mediator if you cannot countenance direct interaction with the person. You are never required to face your abuser in the accountability process, though you may if you feel it is necessary.</li>


        <li>Use specific language in the claim as much as you can, or engage the help of a mediator. This is important in helping the community understand the exact nature of the violation against you. Don’t hesitate to ask for help or consideration.</li>

        <li>Make the claim in front of the smallest audience that you feel comfortable being in front of, which might necessarily be your entire community but might not as well.This is to make sure that enough people get your specific account which will work to prevent uncontrolled fallout through peripheral conversation and rumor spreading while also working to prevent dogpiling in internet spaces.</li>

        <li>There is no wrong way to share your experience, so long as it aids your healing. However, It is important that the people who see your account know that you are going to discuss sensitive or graphic information. The people around you should know the nature of the experience you are going to share beforehand in order to avoid potential harm to the people who are exposed to it.</li>

        <li>If you decide not to confront the person, that is your choice and your healing is what is important. Do not allow someone to guilt or shame your for wanting your healing process to be separated from that person.</li>

        <li>If the person refuses accountability cease contact with them immediately and focus on your own healing. If you share digital spaces with them consider blocking them, if you share in person spaces take precautions such as making sure you have a triad buddy system at a minimum, and do not hesitate to contact security or human resources.</li>

        <li>If you are a confidante or mediator or other second party, First: make no action without the consent of your Trustee. Try to understand what your trustee wants out of the process and help them find resources that are pertinent to their needs. Let them know your availability and limits as early as possible. The emotional involvement of this process can lead a victim to feel abandoned, so early updates on your ability to give them attention can prevent unintentional harm. If the person who did the harm to your trustee is someone you have a prejudice against for some other reason, then you should work to keep that prejudice out of this accountability process because it can set back the healing process.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Suggestion for addressing the person who harmed/abused you</h2>
    <p>There is no right or wrong way for you as a survivor to share your experience of abuse. Regardless of when the abuse occurred, you can share the experience in whatever way is best for your healing. This protocol is just a tool to help</p>
    <p>Some of the most important first steps is to care for yourself. You’ve been hurt and will need to dress your wound. One of the ways to do this is to share this experience with a person you feel comfortable with. While it might feel a daunting task, it allows you to share your feelings with another human being and get support.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>After having this support, it’s important to assess whether you would like to address your abuser directly or not. Ask yourself: would it be beneficial or provide me with closure to directly address my abuser? Would it be too dangerous due to how manipulative or abusive they are? You are never obligated to face your abuser. You don’t owe them anything and if they are trying to push for a meeting with you, you address them only on your terms. Knowing your own limits and never address them alone, even if you’re under the impression that the harm wasn’t intended, for your own safety and only consider addressing them if you’re 100% sure of your own limits.
        <li>
            If you’ve decided that speaking to your abuser will help with your healing, then you take another assessment of what preparations you need to safely confront your abuser.
        </li>
        <ul>
            <li>
                With your supportive mediator/pod, the next steps should be to make sure that the(se) individual(s) are prepared to support you through the process and will not attempt to speak for you without your consent. For more information about pods see the resources [here]. Some tips for characteristics to look for in your pod/support are below.
            </li>
            <ul>
                <li>The(se) individual(s) who would best suit your pod, will need to know what you want from this confrontation. That way they can try to provide support that will further your goal.</li>
                <li>Preferably these individuals would not have prejudices against the alleged abuser, but if they do, will be able to reserve them for your sake, since it could invoke further conflict and worsen any trauma/pain.
                <li>Be careful not to include individuals that do not believe you or gaslight you. If they’re in your support group, they would ineffectively support you and possibly worsen the situation.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>


        <li>If this is impossible, then immediately avoid further interaction with the abuser. Focus on providing yourself with a safe environment.</li>
        <ul>
            <li>If you’re aware that you share open digital spaces with them, block them.</li>
            <li>If you share closed digital spaces with them, or refer to indirect address method.</li>
            <li>If there are events, such as conventions, that they would likely appear at, take precautions in case there is a face to face meeting such as finding close friends to attend with you, alerting people that such an incident may occur, and if necessary alert security.</li>
        </ul>

        <li>After the confrontation, assess whether the confrontation was helpful or not, and whether further steps need to be taken for the healing process.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Indirect Address</h2>
    <p>When unable to directly address your abuser and the abuse, a more indirect address can help heal. This will likely look different for each individual and circumstance, but here are some ideas that could be helpful:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>If you want to engage the abuser indirectly:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Use existing community structures like Approach Groups (link reference doc).</li>
            <li>Form a pod and coordinate with your allies to have someone else approach the abuser on your behalf (pods and podmapping link).</li>
            <li>Seek out mediation. This can be a buffer if you want a neutral third party present for the confrontation, and many mediation centers will allow third party proxies—so someone you trust can sit in an represent you.</li>
            <li>Ask a trusted friend—or a mutual friend who you trust—to approach the abuser on your behalf.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>If you don’t want any engagement:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>See the “avoiding harmful interactions with the abuser” section above. Taking care of yourself and finding support are the most important things.</li>
