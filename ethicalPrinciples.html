    <h1>Ethical Principles</h1>
</head>

<body>

    <p>As per our general recommendations to all communities, the procedures and guidelines outlined in the protocol, shall be considered as governed by the following principles:</p>
    <ol>

        <li>Respect to human dignity: we believe all communities should recognize self-determination, association, personal privacy, inviolability of correspondence and free development of personality. Online and offline, we must recognize one another as individuals and Ends-in-Themselves.</li>

        <li>Due diligence: procedures and guidelines should be carried out according to the terms outlined in the present Protocol, or any that a community might develop by themselves. Acting shall be in due diligence as an obligation of the corresponding ‘authorities’, whichever might constitute the community over which they hold responsibility. The procedure as such should be characterized by reasonable prevention, exhaustive investigation, proportional sanctions and due reparations.</li>


        <li>Confidentiality: any and all revelations of personal information are to be limited to the people involved in the procedure, and only in respect of what they might need to know. Therefore, ‘authorities’ and involved parties should preserve the privacy of personal information along all steps of procedure with the intention of protecting a person’s privacy. The complexity and inherent dubiousness of an online society may always run the risk of misinformation being spread, and we must try to deter bad-faith actors and opportunists from acting thoughtlessly seeing these processes as nothing but resources.</li>


        <li>Impartiality: independently of any qualifications upon a particular denouncement, any and all people are to be treated in the same manner of respect and non-discrimination. Participants should not be considered biased after the fact, and ‘guilt by association’ should always be deterred from taking root Just as well, communities and individuals can exercise their rights to the aforementioned free association and simply decide to not associate with a particular individual.</li>


        <li>Accessibility: procedures should be materially available for any and all people and these shall participate in equal conditions. Just as well, all participation should be considered voluntary from the beginning. An unwillingness to participate in the resolution of a conflict or the discussion of a tragic event should not be seen as being complicit with any act of abuse. Additionally, an open working group might consider producing reports on the situation that others may refer to for recommendations, instead of expecting any and all members of a particular community to look into the entirety of the case themselves.</li>


        <li>No Revictimization: to avoid giving third-parties the opportunity to benefit themselves, the victim shall be treated with respect to their way of being, feeling, thinking and acting, without any mistreatment or differential treatment. More so, having them narrate their story to different people and instances should be avoided, unless strictly necessary or done voluntarily. There is no need to further deliberate over specifics that might cause psychological harm to the particular individuals. Furthermore, continued conversation on such topics can border on harassment for the victim, for which they may naturally lash out.</li>


        <li>Transparency: all procedure and their results should be clearly explained to the parties involved, and all actions should be clearly perceived by involved parties as for their benefit.</li>


        <li>Reconciliation: procedures that a particular community might exercise should be carried out with the ultimate goal of reconciliation, although not between victim and perpetrator, necessarily. A particular victim's input as to the goal of the Protocol implementation should always be taken into account. The effort of limiting and preventing harm is paramount, and revenge goes against this particular principle. As such it is recognized that victims come first, accountability and growth of the abuser comes second. Actions are to be taken toward the goal of safety, not retribution. Accountability should be incentivized through collective action with the goal of producing empathetic community members in mind.</li>


        <li>Honesty: Open and honest communications are important. People should feel that they are able to express what they need and be heard.</li>


        <li>Accountability: none of the above principles should be construed as shielding abusers and perpetrators from responsibility, nor that cases of abuse should be kept secret as an appropriate measure. Instead, we present these suggestions merely as guidelines that communities might adopt to help them benefit survivors and give them the appropriate space and time to heal.</li>


        <li>The Protocol should radically promote the concept of reconciliation as a goal where safe and appropriate. Change your mindset away from punishment. The purpose of this protocol is to limit and prevent harm. Keep in mind that the instinct for revenge will not accomplish less harm and is in fact a method of control. It is normal to want to regain control in a situation where someone has been harmed, but exerting violent control over the accused (or anyone willing to listen to them) will only alienate them from the process of accountability (exceptions being if the abuse is ongoing or likely to imminently reoccur; The safety of the victims must be established before the accountability process can begin). Therefore, any actions taken by the community should be done in the spirit of safety and preventing harm. This means that the victims come first, then accountability and growth of the abuser. This does not mean that we do not take action against someone who is causing harm. Simply that our actions must be toward the goal of safety and not retribution. This allows consequences of abusive actions to occur naturally, ie: an abuser may no longer be allowed access to spaces where they have perpetrated harm until a time if and when the members of that space (most importantly, their victim(s) within that space) have fully reconciled with the abuser and are fully satisfied that they have changed*. This mindset will also serve to discourage harassment campaigns against people who are not directly involved with the conflict since policing opinions on a matter will not increase the safety of anyone involved.</li>

        <li>Also, a reconciliation mindset will create space for abusers to take accountability for their actions and incentivise them to do the work required to become better people and more empathetic community members. We need to be open to the fact that people can and do change, and that perpetual condemnation will galvanize abusive behaviour where reconciliation can lead to stronger community and a wealth of learning and growth. So if the accused is willing to take accountability for the harm they have caused, we must be willing to facilitate reconciliation where possible(if the victim is unwilling to participate, they must not be pressured into it!). This process must be done voluntarily and in good faith by the accused, if it has been determined that harm has been done, and those who have perpetrated harm are unwilling to accept accountability and progress in good faith, then they remain a danger to the community until they do so. *See list of red flags to help weed out bad faith actors attempting to manipulate the process of reconciliation in order to regain access to their victims.</li>


        <li>We shouldn’t consider people to be cancelled or exiled from the community simply because they don’t want to enact recommendations from working group. In other words, if person X is problematic and the working group recommends excluding them from our spaces, but person A wants to keep person X in their community, we may need to then have further discussions as to whether we can agree to disagree or if there’s a safety concern that impacts the whole community needing everyone to act (and what the consequences of not acting on those recommendations should be - eg. if someone is an abuser and needs to be removed from everywhere, what do we do about creators / community activists who refuse to remove them?).</li>

        <li>Trust that principle Adopters of the protocol will respect the choice that other adopters have made, while affording them the space to operate or privacy from those proceedings. This will ensure that all effort is made toward helping the victim heal, and prevent the wasted emotional labor of trying to compel assistance from those wishing to be uninvolved. Adopters of the protocol will also respect the choices of those who choose not to adopt the protocol, though harassment is not acceptable in any case.</li>


        <li>Believe survivors. A person’s account of trauma is their personal truth. Trauma cannot be verified or disproven within a trial based framework, it simply is.</li>


        <li>Everyone has a right to heal. Healing from trauma is an inalienable and fundamental human right.</li>


        <li>Everyone has the capacity to grow. We must not mistake reluctance or unwillingness to accept change at any particular time as a lack of ability to do so.</li>


        <li>Hurt people hurt people. Harmful behavior is not a measure of the quality of a person. It is the product of trauma and the toxic systems we are forced to navigate. While this does not excuse abuse, it is vital to recognize that abuse is a symptom of something greater than any one individual.</li>


        <li>Remember that abuse may not be clear cut. Sometimes two people have harmed one another. Both parties deserve love and support from those who care about them.</li>


        <li>Harm reduction, not elimination. We can reduce the harm caused by others by removing people who are not ready or able to hold themselves accountable from positions of influence whenever possible. We can refuse to promote harmful methods of deplatforming such as threats of violence and doxxing. We cannot, however, eliminate a person from the internet or completely control any particular narrative. Nor can we force a person who is unwilling or unable to hold themselves accountable to any standard of accountability. Harm is, unfortunately, an inevitability that we can simply do our best to cope and support each other with.</li>


        <li>There should be a designated way for any member(s) of leftist spaces to bring forward concerns, esp concerns of feeling unsafe or a toxic environment.. Collective and democratic problem solving should be the norm. There should never be any reprisals for anyone communicating these concerns, and they should be able to do so confidentially (the only reason for breaking confidentiality would be if there were an imminent threat of harm, such as an actionable threat of one member against another).</li>


        <li>Any position in a space which give people authority over others (such as mod) is a privilege. There needs to be a designated way to bring forward requests to remove authority from such a person if it is necessary (such as holding a vote of no-confidence, etc).</li>


        <li>The rights of all people need to be upheld, and any actions which are discriminatory or violate the dignity of another group (use of slurs, etc) should not be tolerated. Should members of a minority or marginalized group bring forward concerns particular to their identity this should be seen as an opportunity to create a better space for all, not a grievance or bother. Any decision that involves a certain group should have members of the group given a voice: “nothing about us without us”.</li>


        <li>Ableism, sexism, etc has no place in these conversations. A person with a history of mental illness should not be treated as less reliable as to their testimonials, a male victim should not be disregarded as a victim because of the myth that men cannot be raped, etc. (It is certainly acceptable for people to bring up such things in terms of assisting the person to give the best opportunity to bring forward issues- such as asking if they need assistance with an interpreter if english is not their first language or if they require breaks and rest if they have an anxiety disorder, however this must be done in an attitude of helpfulness and with care and sensitivity).</li>


        <li>An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. For instance, it is strongly recommended that trainings or information on consent be made available to people. People should also educate themselves on rape myths and facts (please see Protocol Zero). This general principle of making information available to people in order to prevent issues can be broadly applied to multiple situations.</li>


        <li>It needs to be understood that a content creator, mod or any other person will likely have neither the training or the resources to investigate a claim or “get to the bottom” in the way we would all like. There is likely to be doubt unless there is a confession or some extraordinary piece of evidence is found. In cases like this, it is the safety of people that is the utmost concern, and a leftist group must move to protect vulnerable individuals and exercise reasonable judgment. Multiple accusations of harassment or stalking, for instance, may well be considered a reason for dismissal from a group even if absolute proof is not something it would be reasonable to expect a mod of an online group to be able to procure. Wherever possible, democratic principles should apply to decisions of this magnitude.</li>


        <li>It needs to be remembered that, unfortunately, no group of humans is perfect or immune from bad actors. Serious issues will pop up, and there will be fighting and disagreements. This is not a sign of dysfunction necessarily. It is in how these things are handled and what happens when the dust settles that tells us whether we have created a strong and vital community- one that is built to weather the incredible challenges ahead.</li>


        <li>All members of a group, regardless of position or other metrics such as subscriber count or size of an audience, should always be considered equals and no “special treatment” should be accorded to anyone on these bases.</li>


        <li>The specific requirements for reconciling a member will be decided upon by the group and based on the behaviors in question. Some basic principles of what should be expected include:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Admitting to and accepting full responsibility for what they have done</li>
            <li>Accepting responsibility for the consequences of their actions</li>
            <li>Making amends and demonstrating change</li>
            <li>Not trying to control the process</li>
            <li>
            <li>Not making excuses, assigning blame to others, or feeling sorry for themselves</li>
            <li>Not demanding credit for changes or declaring themselves “cured”</li>
            <li>Developing positive behaviors and attitudes to replace harmful ones</li>
            <li>Accepting the need for outside professional help if necessary</li>
        </ul>


        <li>When a situation has arisen within a particular community specifically (such as all victims and accused people being members of the LGBTQIA community) then the needs, emotions, experiences and desires of that marginalized group should be given weight and members outside of the group should accept a stance of open listening and support.</li>


        <li>Ostracization: Summary judgement through inaccurate or incomplete information often leads to punishment of both victims and perpetrators by social ostracization. Both cases lead to bad outcomes. The victims are denied access to the social groups and norms they had previously been part of which damages the healing process, and the perpetrators are left unattended and unaccountable. Although you may choose not to associate with an abuser one your own initiative or on the victim’s, organized ostracization will likely result in a failure of the ‘community’ to find accountable solutions.</li>


        <li>While factors such as religion, profession, consumption lifestyle, and other consumption choices may be viewed as identities by practicing individuals, in the context of this protocol they are ideologies which are open to being critique. Although if an individual person is subjected to abuse based on any of these factors (as a justification for said attacks) those actions will be seen as a violation of the protocol.</li>


        <li>No one is disposable. It is difficult to face unpleasant facts about one’s own behaviour, and people accused of doing wrong and/or harming other comrades will often need social support and a base level of safety in order to face their flaws, admit to any bad behaviour, and grow. Even abusers are people capable of growth. That said, it’s important to remember that an online space is in most cases not the place to facilitate that growth. Asking a person to leave a group to ensure safety is not a sign that this person is “irredeemable”, but an acknowledgment of the limitations in what support can be provided to them.</li>


        <li>Consider the victim’s experience and the perpetrator’s intent separately. The perpetrator’s intentions do not affect the victim’s experience of an event. Many seem to believe that rehabilitation of/compassion for a perpetrator implies that the victim’s suffering is lessened, and this is not necessarily the case.</li>


        <li>Harassment campaigns obstruct discussing the actual issue. When people, especially high profile people, are being hacked, harassed, and doxxed, it becomes impossible to actually discuss the accusation.</li>


        <li>What the person accusing wants is irrelevant in judgement but important in care. What the specific demands and the requirements of the person who makes a claim to some harm are, is unimportant when it comes to the veracity of the claim. However when it comes to care and response for those people, it is very important. We should seek to take these demands into account when care and harm reduction is involved.</li>


        <li>Facilitating accountability and reconciliation are only one element of what we can do to accommodate the needs of people in our spaces who’ve experienced abuse. Facilitating diverse avenues of healing and prevention of harm are important factors to consider. Creators and moderators of all spaces are highly encouraged to explore other avenues of support for vulnerable people present in these spaces, raise awareness, and practice preventative measures.</li>

        <li>You can contribute to someone being harmed without realising. Your actions are mediated through public discourse, power structures, dynamics of spaces you occupy, and individuals’ previous knowledge and experiences, so your actions can have consequences you did not intend or consider.</li>

        <li>Harm is real not imaginary. The harm someone experiences is produced through the interaction of individuals, mediated by the spaces they occupy, their previous experiences, public discourse and power structures. Potential for producing harm exists in all the spaces we occupy and interactions we engage in.</li>
