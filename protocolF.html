    <h1>Protocol F - If you are a content creator or social commentator voluntarily deciding to publish commentary about a claim for which you are a third party</h1>
</head>

<body>
    <p>All the guidelines in Protocol B, Protocol E ,and Protocol Z are generally applicable to this situation too.</p>
    <ul>

        <li>Don’t attempt to generate social capital for yourself. The spectacle of the a resolution process which has turned into a discourse alienates and harms those who are actually involved in the resolution process. Strive to wait until after the dust has settled on the issue. The most insightful commentary will be a retrospective, and allowing more time to take notes and revise your assessments will only help your insights. Trying to do even a neutral commentary while the situation is hot creates too many temptations for other third parties to act in a way that will add fuel to the fire.</li>

        <li>If you do have an insight that makes it difficult to resist the temptation to produce content while the situation is still ongoing, you should strive to keep such commentary as abstract as possible and avoid naming specific actors. The insights you might have about these dynamics are just as valid without naming names. Remember that every commentary that is levied at a specific person that is being dogpiled can add to the pressure and harm they might already be experiencing. The tendency to prolong these conflicts (especially between third parties) tends to only exacerbate collateral damage.</li>

        <li>As for determining when, exactly, a situation has been resolved, potential indicators are typically when the claimant and accused have publicly made some definitive statements or the discourse has stopped talking about the issue for a good number of days. If in doubt, simply wait a bit longer!</li>


        <li>Do not claim that 3rd party bystanders are guilty by association or guilty by inaction for things done prior to knowledge of any claims. Most leftist voices know and interact with each other peripherally at best, in parasocial relationships. Remember that some people have their own history and triggers, so it might simply be painful—or harmful—to insert themselves into the situation, particularly when an accountability process is ongoing.</li>


        <li>Avoid using a harsh or critical attitude towards any person directly involved in the damaging claim. Saying harsh things to or about the victim may cause a secondary trauma and they may be less likely than ever to continue to speak up. This chilling effect leads other people who have experienced similar harm to decide not to come forward if they feel the environment is hostile. This supports rape culture and allows abusers to harm more people. All care should be taken to avoid such a toxic environment. Serious issues like rape and abuse should never be dismissed as “drama”, “in-fighting” or terms of that nature, harassment shouldn’t be dismissed as “discourse”. Additionally after witnessing an uncharitable version of their position from an uninvolved commentator, a compliant accused person complying with what’s required to reach accountability for their actions might become indignant and unwilling to continue, and the denial of accountability will harm the victim who needs it.</li>


        <li>It is good praxis to evaluate serious events in hindsight with the cooperation of the people directly involved in the claim. After a reasonable period of time has taken place, there is a definite benefit to performing a retrospective with all members of a group empowered to comment on their experiences—especially those who were harmed. A frank and productive postmortem comprising mistakes made, improvements needed, as well how the agreed upon path was implemented and what was successful.</li>
    </ul>
