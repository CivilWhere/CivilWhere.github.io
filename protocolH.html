    <h1>Protocol H - If you are experiencing physical or emotional harm in your real-world environment</h1>
</head>

<body>
    <p>The guidelines in Protocol C and Protocol G are generally applicable to this situation too.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>If one or more persons involved in a conflict are unable to access care for their basic needs (defined broadly as food, shelter, medication, and immediate safety for themselves and/or their family) it is within this personâ€™s best interest to identify and address these needs before attempting to resolve the conflict. If the person or persons are unable to access this care directly related to the current conflict, community support systems or other resources must be identified before attempting to address or resolve the conflict. This is only applicable under temporary conditions or conditions related directly to an event or conflict, they are not intended to solve long-term or past access needs. Please refer to the resources (link here)</li>

        <li>The safety of people comes first. No one should be judged for seeking the help of law enforcement if this is what they need to do to protect themselves.</li>


        <li>Have a way out. For these situations, you should prepare or look for what you need to remove yourself if things escalate to a dangerous degree. Try to find trusted friends or potential shelters to stay at.</li>
    </ul>
