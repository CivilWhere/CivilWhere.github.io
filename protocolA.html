    <h1>Protocol A - If someone has made a damaging claim about YOU</h1>
</head>

<body>
    <p>The guidelines in Protocol C, Protocol D, Protocol G, Protocol H , and Protocol X are generally applicable to this situation too. It’s also important to minimize potential harm to both yourself and the person making the claim by “thinking like a 3rd-party mediator” and applying many of the guidelines in Protocol B.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Resist giving a knee-jerk reaction. If you are the subject of a damaging claim that goes against general leftist principles and ideals, STOP and think. Take a step back and put yourself in the shoes of the person making the claim. Might you have not understood the conditions that made your behavior unintentionally harmful? Do you understand the perspective of the claimant or claimants? Even though a claim will likely indicate that you have done something that goes against leftist principles, having done so does not necessarily make you an irredeemable reactionary and you might have taken responsibility and changed yourself since material contained in the claim. We all have to take responsibility for any harm we might have caused others, no matter how far in the past, and show that we have been made accountable for that harm, or are willing to be accountable. If you respond in a knee jerk way it will almost definitely be used to attack you.</li>

        <li>When an accusation of abuse or harassment has been brought forward it is essential that the YOU DO NOT contact the claimant in a way that they have not approved of. After putting out an initial message requesting their mediator contacts you through a medium they find suitable, you should refrain from publicly discussing them. This includes not contacting their family, friends, coworkers, and associates with regards to the claim without those people being agreed upon channels of communication. This is integral to the healing and accountability processes. If membership in a group with people who fit those descriptions makes that impossible the consider taking a hiatus from that group, not necessarily leaving. You should answer any questions by saying you are acting through The Protocol to reach accountability with the claimant to resolve the issue.</li>


        <li>You have the right to not respond to the claim. Nobody has the right to expect or demand a response from you, whether publicly or privately. There are plenty of legitimate reasons you may have for not being able to engage, but you should also be aware that actions (and inactions) have consequences and both the claimants and bystanders may have concerns and are just as free to criticize your silence as you are to maintaining it.</li>


        <li>You have a right to voluntarily leave a leftist space if a damaging claim has been made about you and you do not wish to go through an accountability process. A moderator should inform you that you may not be allowed back in at a later date, as it was your choice not to face accountability for the issue, and it is unreasonable to expect a group with unfixed membership and goals to simply re-visit an old allegation where key information may no longer be available.</li>


        <li>If you accept accountability for the actions in the claim The terms of any method to peaceable resolution should be defined only by the involved individuals. Resolution and accountability should be expressed in terms that both parties understand and agree to, as well as being aligned with the other statements in this protocol.</li>


        <li>If additional claims are added to a claim for which you are already performing an accountability process. If these are made by the original claimants then you and they should decide if the current process is sufficient. If it is brought up by new claimants then they should find out if the accountability process that is currently being undertaken is sufficient for them. Both cases should find or support accountability which includes the new claims.</li>
    </ul>
