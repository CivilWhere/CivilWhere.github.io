    <h1>Protocol B - If you are a 3rd party voluntarily trying to help people affected by a damaging claim</h1>
</head>

<body>
    <p>The guidelines in Protocol D, Protocol E, and Protocol F are generally applicable to this situation too.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Use “I’m sorry you’re going through this” if approached by the claimant, or “sympathy for those affected” if approached by another third party and “let’s follow the protocol” in your first response. The choice of first phrase shows compassion while very specifically not choosing a side. The second phrase serves three important purposes:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>It reminds people aware of The Trust Protocol to check their own gut reactions against the guidelines, and reminds everyone to present a measured and united front.</li>
            <li>It puts everyone who sees the message on notice that derailment tactics, sock-puppeting, manipulation, and harassment probably won’t work. The community is not going to take the bait. A match will burn out for lack of oxygen.</li>
            <li>It prompts people who aren’t aware of The Trust Protocol to ask “what is that?”, which creates an avenue for The Trust Protocol to spread and gain wider adoption.</li>
        </ul>



        <li>If you want to show some support with #1 above, you are NOT required to go any further. A simple response with the two key phrases in #1 is a neutral show of support. No one has a right to ask you to go further and stick your own neck out. Everyone should understand that some leftist voices might want to help with a situation, but still might need to abstain from involvement for reasons of personal well-being. Therefore, we all should strive to resist the temptation to drag other people into a situation especially though a claim of guilt by inaction.</li>

        <li>You should understand the risks before engaging beyond #2 as a bystander. Are you willing to hear or see things that might be unpleasant or triggering in some way? Are you willing to deal with an emotionally volatile situation- including some angry words or accusatory sentiments thrown in your direction too? Make sure you have the energy and fortitude to see it through. You should familiarize yourself with what resources are available as soon as you read this passage. If you find yourself in the position of wanting to support someone, Emergent crisis is not the first time you want to be trying to find resources. Know that publicly committing yourself (and in online spaces, the audience), may be putting more fuel on the fire, and that you can come under attack from it.</li>
        <li>Please note that the references to ‘emotionally volatile situations’ is not intended to excuse harassment or abusive behavior sent to bystanders- there is a distinct difference between an intemperate statement made in a heated moment and harassment.</li>

        <li>Ask them what they need. If someone has come to you in distress it may be difficult for you to work out what they want, or why they are telling you. Remember that distressed people do not always communicate in a generally expected or predictable way, so ask them what they need and be patient. You cannot be required to do anything, but you can’t make and informed decision if you don’t know what is being asked for. The person might not want you to do anything for them, and assuming they do may escalate the situation.</li>

        <li>Assess whether you’re willing and able to provide what you’ve been asked for. You might want to consider the following questions:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Do you have the power to do what’s being asked of you?</li>
            <li>Do you have the emotional and mental capacity to do what’s being asked of you?</li>
            <li>Do you have the emotional and mental capacity to assess whether this is something you are willing or able to provide?</li>
            <li>Do you have enough information to feel comfortable doing what’s been asked of you?</li>
            <li>Are you being asked to take sides, especially without a clear understanding of the situation?</li>
        </ul>

        <li>If you find that you cannot provide what you have been asked for, ask if they would like you to direct them somewhere else they may be able to get the support or accommodation they need. Getting support can be a difficult process for people in distress, try to remain patient and compassionate even if they become frustrated that you are unable to help. Check if they have a support network or close friends they could confide in. Have a look at our Resources document and direct them to somewhere or someone else who might be able to help them more than you can.</li>

        <li>Resist the urge to go beyond expressing sympathy and a call to “follow the protocol” unless you are specifically invited to help mediate by the people directly involved in the claim. Many of us see a comrade in pain or under attack and feel a natural urge to jump in and help. Consider that in many cases “jumping in to help” uninvited can make the situation worse, especially if your sudden presence makes one or both sides feel attacked.</li>


        <li>Prioritize genuine care for all victims first and foremost. A good-faith accuser is a victim of some type of harm, even if the person they’re accusing is ultimately not responsible for that harm. And of course the accused is subject to an entirely different harm of reputation or worse. If you don’t have enough information, strive to maintain neutral language and redirect conversation away from who’s right or wrong and instead to the subject of mitigating harm produced in the dispute, and supporting the healing process for those harmed. What exactly can be done right now to reduce any harm already done and prevent more harm from occurring? A common type of goalpost-moving that will happen even in a good-faith situation is one or both sides lashing out at the other with recriminations about who’s to blame. Again, you can use “let’s stay on protocol” and point out that prioritizing immediate care always comes first.</li>


        <li>Avoid any type of victim blaming. The person who comes forward should be treated with respect and care, their story listened to in a non-judgmental fashion, and excessive or inappropriate questioning (why did you wait a week before coming forward? Why did you go out with X person alone? etc) avoided. To this end, think about what kind of questions you can ask that can understand the victim’s safety and needs better, like “are you safe right now?”. A victim should never feel that they will be subjected to embarrassment or scrutiny on anything not directly related to their situation - such as their personal life and relationships, history of mental illness, disability (particularly cognitive or intellectual) etc.</li>


        <li>Any situation with an imbalance of power should have that imbalance acknowledged and considered. Knowing that power imbalances can cause coercive and abusive situations to arise that might not be visible to the abuser is and important thing to take note of when understanding the nature of the violation. The accountability requirements for an abuse of power will likely be different for a victim, and requirements should be placed as necessary to address this on top of the other components of accountability for the violation.</li>


        <li>At NO time should anyone involved be harassed, dogpiled, or threatened. This type of punitive behavior runs counter to the spirit of restorative justice and is harmful. It invites escalation and the piling on of “trolls” or bad faith actors and should be condemned.</li>


        <li>Canned non-involvement: A canned initial response and a canned reply response for the protocol for when you’re being coerced or harassed. The initial response might not be enough for either emotionally engaged people or bad actors. Another set of canned phrases will allow anyone familiar with the protocol to know that you are being coerced or harassed. Neutral, Standardized language will defuse good faith attention and disempower bad faith attacks. The assumption in these phrases is that you are not being contacted by the claimant themself.</li>
        <ul>
            <li>For a standard post after coercion has commenced:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>“I have been asked to (do something) and i do not have the expertise to understand the situation. Though I have sympathy for those affected i have to sit out, please abide the trust principle.”</li>
            </ul>
            <li>And for a reply:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>“I’ve chosen to sit out, please respect the trust principle and my decision.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>

        <li>If the claimant is contacting you while you are being coerced or harassed about your decision ask them to intercede on your behalf while you find the time to make an informed decision.</li>


        <li>To whatever extent is possible, focus on the present and the future. You may never truly know what happened between two people but you can know that harm has been experienced by one or more parties. Focus on ways to resolve continuing harm rather than trying to determine the ‘facts’ of the situation. What can be known is what people need now and going forward to be safe and supported enough to heal and/or be accountable for their actions and prevent them from occurring again.</li>


        <li>While conflict or harassment is ongoing, try to keep people experiencing harm or triggers from coming into conflict with one another. The reason that one person might be willing to coerce or harass another is because of their past trauma, this might also be the reason why someone is refraining from being involved. When people are emotionally vulnerable, misunderstandings, which are likely to occur anyway, often keep the conflict going and grow it and extend its harm to more people.</li>


        <li>Punishment is not the goal, do not approach the issue with punishment in mind. The safety of the victim and the relevant communities come first. Accountability, Reconciliation and rehabilitation come second. Punishment does not support these objectives.</li>
    </ul>
