We must acknowledge that no action is isolated, that participating in online disputes can be traumatizing for all people involved, and that we all have a collective duty to minimize harm. Learning effective techniques for online engagement is a part of a process of learning and healing. The effects of online abuse are still largely dismissed. Responding to trauma and allegations of abuse should be done in a thoughtful way that encourages healing and growth. We must collectively aspire to minimize the occurrence of harmful cycles, and to learn how to respond to problems in a more thoughtful way. Through the strength of our personal ethics, we have the potential to influence others to also respond appropriately to harmful situations, and to avoid contributing to a toxic environment of online harassment. We can and should raise the bar for society and for all online communities, influencing them to behave more responsibly. Harassment is unfortunately still commonplace online, and it limits people&#39;s ability to engage in </span><span>prosocial</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;discourse, find community, and connect with others.</span></p><p class="c7 c17"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c7 c17"><span class="c4"></span></p><h2 class="c3" id="h.9fgqlh9l7572"><span class="c27">Helpful Resources</span></h2><p class="c7"><span>The working group that developed The Trust Protocol is in no position to provide direct assistance, counseling, or legal advice to any parties harmed.<br><br>However, the working group comprises a diverse set of individuals and professionals who are familiar with well-respected organizations who do specialize in these types of support and care.

Just as well, all participation should be considered voluntary from the beginning. An unwillingness to participate in the resolution of a conflict or the discussion of a tragic event should not be seen as being complicit with any act of abuse. Additionally, an open working group might consider producing reports on the situation that others may refer to for recommendations, instead of expecting any and all members of a particular community to look into the entirety of the case themselves.<br></span></li><li class="c16 c8"><span class="c15">No Revictimization: </span><span>to avoid giving third-parties the opportunity to benefit themselves, the victim shall be treated with respect to their way of being, feeling, thinking and acting, without any mistreatment or differential treatment.

A particular victim&#39;s input as to the goal of the Protocol implementation should always be taken into account. &nbsp;The effort of limiting and preventing harm is paramount, and revenge goes against this particular principle. As such it is recognized that victims come first, accountability and growth of the abuser comes second. Actions are to be taken toward the goal of safety, not retribution. Accountability should be incentivized through collective action with the goal of producing empathetic community members in mind.<br></span></li><li class="c16 c8"><span class="c15">Honesty: </span><sup><a href="#cmnt54" id="cmnt_ref54">[bb]</a></sup><sup><a href="#cmnt55" id="cmnt_ref55">[bc]</a></sup><sup><a href="#cmnt56" id="cmnt_ref56">[bd]</a></sup><sup><a href="#cmnt57" id="cmnt_ref57">[be]</a></sup><span>Open and honest communications are important.

Instead, we present these suggestions merely as guidelines that communities might adopt to help them benefit survivors and give them the appropriate space and time to heal.<br></span></li><li class="c16 c8"><span class="c15">The Protocol should radically promote the concept of reconciliation as a goal where safe and appropriate.</span><span>&nbsp;Change your mindset away from punishment. The purpose of this protocol is to limit and prevent harm. Keep in mind that the instinct for revenge will not accomplish less harm and is in fact a method of control. It is normal to want to regain control in a situation where someone has been harmed, but exerting violent control over the accused (or anyone willing to listen to them) will only alienate them from the process of accountability (exceptions being if the abuse is ongoing or likely to imminently reoccur; The safety of the victims must be established before the accountability process can begin). </span><span>Therefore, any actions taken by the community should be done in the spirit of safety and preventing harm. This means that the victims come first, &nbsp;then accountability and growth of the abuser.</span><span class="c15">&nbsp;This does not mean</span><span>&nbsp;that we do not take action against someone who is causing harm. Simply that our actions </span><span class="c15">must</span><span>&nbsp;be toward the goal of safety and not retribution. This allows consequences of abusive actions to occur naturally, ie: an abuser may no longer be allowed access to spaces where they have perpetrated harm until a time if and when the members of that space (most importantly, their victim(s) within that space) have fully reconciled with the abuser and are fully satisfied that they have changed*. This mindset will also serve to discourage harassment campaigns against people who are not directly involved with the conflict since policing opinions on a matter will not increase the safety of anyone involved.<br><br></span><span>Also, </span><span>a reconciliation mindset will create space for abusers to take accountability for their actions and incentivise them to do the work required to become better people and more empathetic community members. We need to be open to the fact that people can and do change, and that perpetual condemnation will galvanize abusive behaviour where reconciliation can lead to stronger community and a wealth of learning and growth. So if the accused is willing to take accountability for the harm they have caused, we must be willing to facilitate reconciliation where possible(if the victim is unwilling to participate, they </span><span class="c15">must not </span><span>be pressured into it!). This process </span><span class="c15">must</span><span>&nbsp;be done voluntarily and in good faith by the accused, if it has been determined that harm has been done, and those who have perpetrated harm are unwilling to accept accountability and progress in good faith, then they remain a danger to the community until they do so.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>*See list of red flags to help weed out bad faith actors attempting to manipulate the process of reconciliation in order to regain access to their victims.</span><sup><a href="#cmnt58" id="cmnt_ref58">[bf]</a></sup><sup><a href="#cmnt59" id="cmnt_ref59">[bg]</a></sup><span class="c4"><br></span></li><li class="c8 c16"><span class="c15">We shouldn&rsquo;t consider people to be cancelled or exiled from </span><span class="c15">the community</span><sup><a href="#cmnt60" id="cmnt_ref60">[bh]</a></sup><sup><a href="#cmnt61" id="cmnt_ref61">[bi]</a></sup><sup><a href="#cmnt62" id="cmnt_ref62">[bj]</a></sup><sup><a href="#cmnt63" id="cmnt_ref63">[bk]</a></sup><span class="c15">&nbsp;simply because they don&rsquo;t want to enact recommendations from working group</span><span>. In other words, if person X is problematic and the working group recommends excluding them from our spaces, but person A wants to keep person X in their community, we may need to then have further discussions as to whether we can agree to disagree or if there&rsquo;s a safety concern that impacts the whole community needing everyone to act (and what the consequences of not acting on those recommendations should be - eg. if someone is an abuser and needs to be removed from everywhere, what do we do about creators / community activists who refuse to remove them?).<br><br></span><span class="c4">Trust that principle Adopters of the protocol will respect the choice that other adopters have made, while affording them the space to operate or privacy from those proceedings.

The pod then works with the accused person to formulate a response. It is important to note that not all of the accountability asks may necessarily be realistic or feasible. For example, if the ask is that the accused person sees a professional counselor once a week, the person might not have access to affordable health insurance. If the ask would result in the loss of the accused&rsquo;s income, they might have a moral objection to that if other people rely on that income. The accused is entitled to decline any of the terms for any reason, understanding that they may face consequences for doing so.<br></span></li><li class="c7 c8"><span class="c6 c15">Escalation</span><span class="c6">.</span><span class="c6 c15">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">As a matter of good faith, and keeping with the principle of harms reduction, the accuser&rsquo;s pod should initially assume that the accused has every intention to comply with the accountability asks. However, as the accountability process progresses and the willingness of the other person becomes more apparent, escalated measure may be deemed necessary on the part of the pod. For example, the accuser initially wishes to keep the accountability process confidential, but when the accused refuses to admit harm the pod agrees to make the process public. Escalation should always keep harms reduction in the forefront, and should never be designed to inflict harm. The pod must continue to ask itself if taking steps to escalate will result in a different outcome or if the motivation is simply vengeance. When it becomes clear that the accused is not going to move any further toward accountability, escalation is no longer useful. Survivors will continue to need support, and it is important for them to find a different means to heal, and/or reconcile with the accused person on the points of accountability on which they agree to cooperate. &nbsp; </span></li></ol><p class="c7 c17 c25"><span class="c0"></span></p><ol class="c10 lst-kix_cd21yfh26pps-0" start="7"><li class="c7 c8"><span class="c6 c15">Reconciliation</span><span class="c0">. If the accused is willing and able to follow through with the accountability asks, the two people in question are able to move toward a process of reconciliation. This will look different for every case. As an accused person is able to grow and learn from the harm they have caused, that growth should be recognized by the survivor and/or their pod. If the accused person was removed from certain spaces because they posed a threat, it might be deemed that they are no longer the threat they once were and they can be welcomed back in. If the harm was made public, the efforts that an accused person made should be made equally public.</span></li></ol><p class="c7 c17 c25"><span class="c0"></span></p><ol class="c10 lst-kix_cd21yfh26pps-0" start="8"><li class="c7 c8"><span class="c6 c15">Aftermath. </span><span class="c6">Conflicts and harmful behavior between two people will never reach a complete conclusion</span><span class="c6 c15">.</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;From the moment trauma is experienced, it lives on in the bodies and minds of those who experience it. And while accountability is sometimes a simple and straightforward process, sometimes it spans over the course of a person&rsquo;s lifetime. With that in mind, it conflicts do tend to reach an equilibrium after a formal accountability process has been attempted. This will happen once there is a reconciliation, or when it is clear that no amount of further escalation will work to hold the accused person more accountable. Pods may wish to stop convening formally, but it is nonetheless important for both people involved to continue to receive love and support from those who care about them, no matter the outcome. At this point in time, when the conflict is mentioned publicly, it is important to refer back to the outcome.</span><span class="c6 c15">&nbsp;</span></li></ol><p class="c7 c17"><span class="c0"></span></p><h3 class="c32" id="h.wehyvouo9ll6"><span class="c19">Draft more general tools and guidelines which can be implemented in all spaces under all circumstances</span></h3><p class="c7 c17"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c4">Amelia: Ref my comments on protocol Y + Temporary Commentary ref the necessity to provide more general information, guidelines and resources for support and prevention which can be implemented in all spaces *regardless* of the presence of a damaging claim, I&rsquo;ll be working on drafting up a separate segment which can address these things. &nbsp;Will tag in some people who felt the same need for this for help and contributions..

That&#39;s why I would want the protocol to have some guideline for when escalation is appropriate vs when it&#39;s simply done to cause harm (i.e. in bad faith).

We can provide resources in the protocol (using the &quot;UI/UX funnel&quot; I discussed in my thougfhts on the scope of the project, if anyone isn&#39;t sure what I&#39;m talking about let me know), but it seems to me (a non-expert!) that the most important role and responsibility for untrained outsiders is to try to protect the victim from further trauma, de-escalate the situation, and push the people involved towards more healthy and useful resources without dismissing them. It&#39;s a balancing act but I am deeply concerned that trying to take on roles we aren&#39;t equipped for can do significant inadvertent harm, similar to trying to practice heart surgery with no medical training.

And I think this plays a very big part in why I think it&#39;s important to stress what people can do *outside of conflict resolution* and how we can accommodate vulnerable people in our communities, period, rather than just having guidelines for how to respond when shit hits the fan.</span></p><p class="c2 c17"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">It requires a lot LESS expertise to do simple things like provide venting spaces, familiarise yourself with resources to direct people to *whenever*, not just when they&#39;re bringing accusations to the table. it requires a lot less expertise to have information about consent, victim blaming,.. available and easily accessible in your spaces and periodically refer to them. *Because* of the lack of expertise it would be handy to make simple pointers widely available about Do-s and Don&#39;t-s in empathetically responding to people who confide in you about things they&#39;ve gone through (*outside* of &quot;here are accusations, fix this!&quot;). That sort of thing, you know? Those are all tools that provide really basic, relatively easy options to create an environment that feels more &quot;aware&quot; of vulnerable people&#39;s presence and is more attuned to their needs and I actually feel like, while protocols for how to respond when shit really starts to fly are extremely *necessary* , they are also many steps further removed from the simplest most basic stuff we can do to just create a more supportive and considerate climate. In fact, I think an overall more supportive and considerate climate and visibly, actively giving a toss about creating those, can PREVENT more extreme call-outs and escalating situations because people *will* feel better understood, supported, like there&#39;s space and attention for these issues. I *really* don&#39;t feel this entire thing can exist without those things present and I also feel like the lack of them just furthers the perception that people are just trying to cover their asses in case of a crisis rather than genuinely care.</span></p></div><div class="c9"><p class="c2"><a href="#cmnt_ref122" id="cmnt122">[dr]</a><span class="c4">So it seems to me like we need both - simple advice and guidelines for empathetically supporting and responding to people who are hurting and creating safer and more welcoming spaces (within the acknowledged limitations of online spaces) as well as guidelines for what to do when things get uncomfortable and/or boil over. For my part I&#39;ve always felt like I am a pretty empathetic and sensitive person, but I am also unfamiliar with this entire language and practice &nbsp;of crisis and conflict management, and also I have many many mental illness aspects that make any sort of conflict incredibly stressful and uncomfortable for me and highly increase the likelihood that I&#39;ll do inadvertent harm. That&#39;s why I personally feel like I personally could use simple, direct guidelines for what to do in these situations. But I would also love to learn the more basic theory and best practices stuff like Amelie is talking about. So maybe in our &quot;funnel&quot; we need a &quot;Step Zero&quot; before we get to the &quot;crisis steps&quot; that just says &quot;I am not currently in any crisis, but I want to learn ways to prevent them before they happen and create more nurturing spaces,&quot; and that&#39;s where we put the info/advice Amelie is talking about?</span></p></div><div class="c9"><p class="c2"><a href="#cmnt_ref123" id="cmnt123">[ds]</a><span class="c4">Anything falling under the category of &quot;simple advice and guidelines for empathetically supporting/responding to people who are hurting and creating safer spaces&quot; is ALREADY part of the protocols. &nbsp;There are already lots of actionable guidelines that try to do exactly that. &nbsp;Protocol Z is what *anyone* can independently do. Protocol Y is what moderators of moderated spaces can do. Protocol B is what 3rd parties trying to come help a situation can do. </span></p><p class="c2 c17"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">In other words, the *place* to put such guidelines is already there. *Some* guidelines to this effect are already there.

This entire protocol is drafted from the perspective of &quot;how do we damage control when accusations are made&quot;. That those protocols then entail a number of scattered suggestions for actions which may *also* apply in general circumstances, is the world upside down. *that* is my point and *that* is why I think *general* measures for support outside of the scope of leveled accusations, need to be clearly and separately addressed, so that &quot;what to do in case of accusations&quot; becomes part of the larger narrative of how to care for and support victims of abuse in our spaces, not that being generally supportive and accommodating to them becomes sort of an obscure tag-on to face-saving and de-escalation tactics employed in case of accusations. I think there is a *very* big misunderstanding of the reasoning behind what I&#39;m saying here and I&#39;m going to keep repeating till I feel people understand *where* the concern is coming from. It&#39;s not that there aren&#39;t a couple of generally applicable guidelines scattered throughout the protocols, it&#39;s that framing them within an overarching context of crisis management and conflict resolution is simply incorrect and actually *damaging* cause it gives the impression of a narrative that things can largely be ignored *until crisis occurs* .</span></p><p class="c2 c17"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">I know, &quot;what&#39;s the problem still?&quot; since I&#39;ll be working on some stuff around this, but let me be abundantly clear: it&#39;s this seemingly lacking understanding of prioritising victims in *all circumstances* and how the current framework *does not reflect that*, and how crisis management and accountability/reconciliation should be considered *one aspect* of a healing-focused framework, that is causing several people who have experienced abuse themselves to feel uncomfortable working on this and with the entire project itself because they understandably feel that vicitms&#39; needs are not being centered, and that people don&#39;t really understand the concept of that and how &quot;this ain&#39;t it&quot;.</span></p></div><div class="c9"><p class="c2"><a href="#cmnt_ref125" id="cmnt125">[du]</a><span class="c4">Like I&#39;m sorry to keep endlessly beating this drum, but if several people who&#39;ve been affected by these issues are sounding the alarm about how they experience this doc as seriously lacking and even harmful, it&#39;s perhaps not the time to shrug and keep on about how it&#39;s all already in here. Great that I get to explore and work on this, but I hope you understand that it&#39;s particularly this apparent &quot;I don&#39;t get what the issue is?&quot; kind of attitude that is *really* disheartening to a number of us and I would really, please, like to ask if we can all mind to stop thinking of this as just curbing conflict, saving face, managing crisis, whatever, and start centering victim care and support in our framing and to heed that that does NOT only entail &quot;solving&quot; accusations. I really don&#39;t mean to sound harsh, but speaking from a background of abuse myself, I&#39;m feeling a kind of sense of despair that I don&#39;t seem to be able to properly convey the whole damn reason *why* its current state is insufficient and make that understandable somehow. I don&#39;t know how to fix that misunderstanding, but it does need fixing, because I feel dismissed and unheard. Not as a contributor, because I&#39;m clearly getting the chance to work this out, but as someone who&#39;s experienced this type of violence, so all I can do is express that honestly right now and I hope that can be treated with some consideration.
