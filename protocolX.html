    <ul>
        <li>Ask for help. You are entitled to decide the manner by which this is brought to attention.</li>


        <li>Decide whether you think the harm will need a formal process of accountability. In many cases, the person who caused harm is willing to be responsible for their actions and hold themselves accountable to you directly. If this is not possible due to the severity of the harm or other complications, a formal process is more appropriate.</li>


        <li>Form a pod and request that the person who did harm do the same. For more information on how to form a pod, see The Trust Protocol Resource Page (link here).</li>


        <li>Media Silence. Once pods have formed, refrain from publicly speaking out against the person who has done harm before they have had an opportunity to hold themselves accountable. Ask the people who have reached out to support to do the same.</li>


        <li>Make specific demands for accountability. Work with your pod to determine how to best approach this. See The Trust Protocol Resource Page for support in developing ways to communicate your needs and examples of what that could look like.</li>


        <li>Escalation. If escalation and/or publicity within your accountability process is agreed to be necessary, it should always keep harm reduction in focus and should never be designed to inflict harm. Ask yourself if taking steps to escalate will result in a different outcome or if the motivation is simple vengeance.</li>


        <li>Reconciliation. If the person who caused harm is able to grow and learn from the harm they have caused, you or your pod should consider acknowledging that growth. If the harm was made public or done publicly, you or your pod might consider making accountability results or efforts equally public.</li>


        <li>Aftermath. Once youâ€™ve reached a reconciliation or it is clear that no amount of further escalation will work to hold the person who caused harm more accountable, consider focusing on more personal self care measures. Continue to seek support from close relationships.</li>
    </ul>
