    <h1>Protocol D - If someone has made a damaging claim about the accuracy/fairness of your published content</h1>
</head>

<body>
    <p>The guidelines in Protocol B, Protocol E, Protocol F ,and Protocol X are generally applicable to this situation too.</p>
    <ul>

        <li>Assume people are criticising your content in good faith and refrain from knee-jerk reactions. Take the time to reflect and see if you can understand where people are coming from. If you feel like there are points that are fair and which you can concede to, acknowledge them and do so immediately through the medium you were contacted on, and consider adding an addendum to either another video or the description of your video.</li>


        <li>If you feel criticism is not justified or stems from a misunderstanding of your position, you can politely provide clarifications or elaboration. Refrain from overly defensive or aggressive language, maintaining a neutral posture especially by asking for clarification or sources as necessary may help diffuse misunderstandings, and inform you better on the circumstances themselves.</li>


        <li>When you respond, acknowledge the effort people have made to engage with and reflect on your content. It is important to note that many claims, especially claims in response to long form content, are going to be made with the best of intentions, whether or not they are valid, it is important to try to understand why the person thought they were valid, and to make sure the person understands that you are not dismissing their concerns.</li>


        <li>Chances are you will not see eye to eye with the people criticising your content. There’s little point in an endless cycle of expressing the same disagreement. After clarifications, sources, and other rationale are produced, if you find that you don’t accept their criticism, Drop the issue, because it is no longer constructive. Consider muting the thread.</li>

    </ul>
