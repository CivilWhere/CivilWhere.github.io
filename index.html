    <h2>What is The Trust Protocol?</h2>
            <h3><i>“FIRST, DO NO HARM.” - Hippocrates</i></h3>

            <p>The Trust Protocol is a set of concrete recommended actions that any individual or group in the leftist movement can apply to common problem situations that occasionally appear in leftist spaces (though this Protocol may be used by other groups as well). These recommended actions are designed first and foremost to minimize existing harm and prevent further harm, both to the people directly involved in the process, and for the broad leftist movement as a whole. The Protocol also contains a broad code of ethical principles that form the basis for the recommended actions in The Protocol itself.</p>

            <p>An advantage of having a named and tangible protocol is that when sticky situations arise, you can use it to guide your personal actions in measured and effective responses to some problematic situation you find yourself involved in. There are actionable guidelines for the people directly involved in a damaging claim, and for third-party bystanders who are dragged into (or voluntarily enter) the resulting dispute.</p>

            <p>Another advantage is that people who aren’t directly involved in a claim can point at The Trust Protocol as a shorthand way of explaining/defending their actions (or inaction) in response to the situation. Being able to say “hey, we have a protocol for situations like this” can be a very effective tactic for minimizing harm for everyone who is touched somehow by a problematic situation.</p>

            <p>The more participants within the broad leftist movement that apply The Protocol’s guidelines and ethical principles to our published content, our social commentary, and to our interactions in groups and across social media, the more resilient we become to bad actors who try to divide and conquer us through targeted harassment, derailment, and divisive rhetoric. Voluntary adoption of The Trust Protocol can enable all of us on the left to support each other and minimize harm.</p>

            <p>The protocol also gives us a productive way to respond to true claims that might happen among the broader leftist community. A way to leave the door open for rehabilitation and growth, rather than slowly deleting each other with unrealistically unforgiving purity tests while falling prey to incitement by bad actors.</p>

            <h2>What The Trust Protocol is NOT</h2>
            <p>The Trust Protocol is not a weapon. It’s not meant to limit your individual voice, nor to be used as a tool for leftists to silence valid concerns. Whether you observe the protocol is entirely voluntary at all times. You can try to observe all of the guidelines, or only the ones you agree with.</p>

            <p>It’s critical to remember that we are all human, with human failings. None of us deserve to be put on a pedestal, because we are all fallible. We should accept that any of us will make human mistakes now and again, and instead of trying to police each other about those mistakes or trying to gain social capital through callouts about each other’s human mistakes, we should instead focus on positive support and and recognition that all of us are capable of growing and learning from our mistakes.</p>

            <p>In crude terms, if we instantly dogpile on each other for some perceived wrong, choose sides, and play all the sectarian politics and competitive games we’re conditioned to play by capitalist society, we’re simply pushing whichever person into a corner and triggering defenses. In many cases, the broader leftist movement has even fallen for schemes organized by bad actors. It’s incredibly rare that any positive growth comes out of such reactions. In fact, we see time and again that significant harm can occur from such dogpiling and purity-testing—often to bystanders who had nothing to do with the original situation.</p>

            <h2>The Context in which The Trust Protocol Was Developed</h2>
            <p>The Trust Protocol has been developed in era where society is still learning how to recognize and minimize harm done by individuals or society, especially in online spaces. We must acknowledge that no action is isolated, that participating in online disputes can be traumatizing for all people involved, and that we all have a collective duty to minimize harm. Learning effective techniques for online engagement is a part of a process of learning and healing. The effects of online abuse are still largely dismissed. Responding to trauma and allegations of abuse should be done in a thoughtful way that encourages healing and growth. We must collectively aspire to minimize the occurrence of harmful cycles, and to learn how to respond to problems in a more thoughtful way. Through the strength of our personal ethics, we have the potential to influence others to also respond appropriately to harmful situations, and to avoid contributing to a toxic environment of online harassment. We can and should raise the bar for society and for all online communities, influencing them to behave more responsibly. Harassment is unfortunately still commonplace online, and it limits people's ability to engage in prosocial discourse, find community, and connect with others.</p>

            <p>The working group that developed The Trust Protocol is in no position to provide direct assistance, counseling, or legal advice to any parties harmed.</p>
            <p>However, the working group comprises a diverse set of individuals and professionals who are familiar with well-respected organizations who do specialize in these types of support and care. Look in this separate Resources (need to add a link) page for a list of such organizations</p>
            <p>Be aware that no specific claims or warranties are made by the working group about any of these organizations. The Resources (link) page simply lists organizations that seem to be capable and well-respected overall in the public sphere.</p>
