    <h1>Protocol Zero - Creating sensitive and accommodating spaces</h1>
</head>

<body>
    <p>The guidelines in Protocol Z are generally applicable to this situation too.</p>

    <p>These protocols can be used for any form of harm, but Sexual violence is a pervasive issue in all of society. The guidelines in this protocol can contribute to creating spaces which are more sensitive to those who have been harmed generally, and the issue of sexual violence specifically.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>You are responsible for yourself first and foremost. Co-producing safer spaces and treating each other well starts with the individual. Remember to take care of your own physical and emotional needs. If you find yourself in a situation that is difficult for you to manage, make sure to rest and take breaks when you need them. Because of the responsibility, and emotional labor of it, be sure to ask for help when you need it, and look for resources or guidance, especially from people who have been in a similar situation.</li>
        <li>Make the use of content warnings standard practice in your space. If you know a piece of content is likely to be disturbing and/or distressing for a large amount of people, it's always a good idea to warn people so they can decide if that's something they want to encounter. Trigger warnings are appropriate when discussing events that may cause people who have experienced similar trauma to relive their experience (PTSD flashbacks). Content warnings are used for other, likely less distressing, content that users may find unsuitable for every environment and audience.</li>
        <li>Make information about consent and that debunks misinformation about sexual violence easily accessible in your space. Accurate information and education contribute to the prevention of sexual violence and harassment in the first place. Information about consent can be found here ( → link (doc unfinished)), and about myths surrounding sexual violence here ( → link (doc unfinished))</li>
        <li>Make information about victim blaming easily accessible in your space, refrain from engaging in victim blaming, and address it when you see it happen. Victim blaming shames and silences people who have experienced sexual violence or harassment. Because the myth of victim responsibility is especially insidious it requires a more focused pamphlet, so more information about victim blaming can be found here ( → link (doc unfinished))</li>
        <li>Make links to resources for people affected by sexual violence and harassment easily accessible in your space, and familiarize yourself with them. Finding the specific and accurate information can be daunting and complex, especially for people who have experienced sexual violence. Being able to point them in the right direction can be extremely helpful. Some information about available resources can be found here ( → link)</li>
        <li>Make information on empathetic communication easily accessible in your space. People might be at a loss when it comes to responding to more emotional, especially traumatic, experiences and may unintentionally further the harm with an uninformed response, despite their best intentions. Information on how to communicate with someone responding to such an experience will help create a more accommodating environment for people in your space who’ve had these experiences. You can find more information on helpful and empathetic communication here ( → link (doc unfinished))</li>
        <li>Address untoward and invasive behaviour or comments when you see them occurring in your space. Bystander intervention at the earliest possible juncture puts both perpetrators of inappropriate behavior and witnesses on notice that your space does not tolerate harassment or abuse on any level and helps prevent escalation to more extreme forms of harmful behaviour. It also signals anyone who may be a target of this behaviour that their safety and comfort matter, and prevents silencing.</li>
        <li>Where possible, create a designated safe area in your space for people who have experienced sexual violence or harassment where they can share and vent about their experiences. Experiences of sexual violence can be very isolating and people affected can often feel alone and misunderstood. Although we should strive for all spaces to be inclusive to survivors,having a place you know is safe for you to share your experiences can be helpful. If you want to establish such an area, make sure you are able to do so securely with the privacy and safety of the people concerned in mind. Information about how can be found here ( → link (doc unfinished))</li>
        <li>Establish clear rules and guidelines about harassment and abusive behaviour, including links to valuable information mentioned throughout this protocol. Specific attention for and sensitivity to sexual violence and harassment in your space can help decrease its occurrence and creates a more accommodating environment to those affected by it.</li>
    </ul>


    <p><b>NOTE:</b> All members of a given space inherently have the ability to observe the guidelines described in this protocol. People who occupy positions of power in their spaces (such as admins or moderators) and people who may hold more social capital (such as content creators) should consider their increased opportunity to draw attention to and implement these guidelines.</p>
