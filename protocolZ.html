    <h1>Protocol Z - If you are an active member in a leftist space who witnessed the situation resulting from a damaging claim</h1>
</head>

<body>

    <p>The guidelines in Protocol B are generally applicable to this situation too.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>A community that has gone through an internal ordeal, has done all that they can to resolve situations: reviewed practices, admitted and apologized for errors and engaged in healing, engaged in reconciliation and restoration for the victim should then consider the situation resolved. It should not be something that individual members should drag out again in future situations “Oh X is such garbage, you remember what they did that time…” This is an unacceptable bad faith tactic.</li>


        <li>Often, victims will want to maintain as much of their privacy as they can, so victims of abuse should expect confidence and privacy from the people they reach out to, until they are ready to come forward with their claims. This kind of private conversation to aid the healing of the victim should not be used to construe that the confidante was hiding evidence in order to support an abuser. In such a situation if the confidante has been a confidante of other people abused by the same person, they can say that without naming the victims unless they have been cleared by those victims. The support and information that a victim receives from their confidantes shouldn’t be used publicly without the consent of the those confidantes.</li>


        <li>We should not rely on whisper campaigns, A whisper campaign is where individuals use direct messaging, private conversations, and other means of direct communication between small privileged groups to disseminate sensitive, often damaging information. As often as not they are used to harm victims instead of to prevent victimization, and because of their clandestine nature it is impossible to know who has been informed. This leads to a no-responsibility situation where a poor uniformity of information makes some people get bombarded by the campaign and others left uninformed and vulnerable while completely avoiding accountability processes for the accused.</li>


        <li>Comfort in, dump out. If you are experiencing emotional upset, triggers, or secondary trauma but are not at the centre of the conflict, process your negative feelings with people who are further removed from the heart of the conflict than you are. Your feelings are important and real, but they may contribute to overwhelm and/or the emotional burden of people who are being more directly harmed. Remember to protect the confidence and privacy of victims by avoiding names and details and focusing instead on your own feelings.</li>


        <li>Do not use accusations as a jumping off point for any bones you might have to pick with ANYONE involved. During this process is not the time to come at people for their political tendency, or other non-harmful online behaviour you might dislike. This only opens the door for personal attacks and harassment. Additionally, the claims and accountability you may want to make for other harmful behaviors should be done in the same way as other claims.</li>


        <li>Do not speculate and discourage speculation in others. It may be tempting to use prior experience with abuse cases to make assumptions about what people involved have said and done. Please stick to what you know has been said/done so as to not muddy the discussion or slander involved parties.</li>

        <li>To generally avoid all “character building” tactics: When an accusation comes to light and there is no conclusive evidence, the adherents of this protocol should generally avoid strategies that involve “building a character profile”. This includes behaviours that aren’t related to the accusation but associate negative characteristics to any person involved. This doesn’t help with the case in particular and is often abused. It’s also commonly used to silence victims or pressure victims into not speaking up in the first place. It’s important to remember that a person you personally think is “bad” may still be victims of abuse.</li>

        <li>If the victim agrees to a resolution, accept it. Do not drag up their trauma at a later date to attack the accused for unrelated reasons if the victim has agreed that the matter is resolved.</li>


        <li>All public statements should be made with accommodations to disabled people. This includes no minimization of terms commonly mocked like “triggers” or “spoons” and including trigger warnings in public announcements regarding to the affair.</li>


        <li>Don’t pester creators about their opinion on the matter. The need for care and privacy of those involved should be respected and content creators should be free to decide whether or not they should weigh in, especially when the situation is not yet resolved or understood.</li>


        <li>Don’t feel the need to rush to the defense of a person or platform you like. The nature of parasocial relationships, especially when you’ve financially invested in the other party via Patreon, buying merch, or books, can be intense. It is important to note that criticism of a platformed person is not a criticism of you.</li>


        <li>These times can be sensitive. Please be civil in all engagements. There is no excuse for using opposing views as a jumping off point for victim blaming, racism, xenophobia, homophobia, ableism, anti-semitism, Islamophobia, transphobia, or serophobia.</li>


        <li>Wanting a different method of resolution doesn’t make someone an authoritarian. Don’t call people “cops”, “KGB”, “SS”, “FBI”, “CIA”, or any other term with similar connotations.</li>


        <li>Resist the temptation dismiss any criticism out of hand, or to paint anyone involved in the situation as a bad actor. It’s best to assume that people on both sides are operating in good faith unless there are clear signs otherwise. Don’t call them “social capitalists” or say they’re disingenuous by calling them a psyop from outside communities such as KiwiFarms or 4Chan.</li>


        <li>Throughout any incident of confrontation, accusation, mediation, and resolution all involved should be treated as human beings. Human beings are imperfect, unique, and not disposable. Language that paints a dichotomy of othering and lessening the value of people involved should be avoided to help prevent the mindset of “us and them”/”with or against”</li>
