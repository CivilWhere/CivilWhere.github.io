        <h1>Protocol C - If YOU feel tangibly harmed by the situation resulting from a damaging claim (e.g. targeted harassment)</h1>
        <p>The guidelines in Protocol G, Protocol H and Protocol X are generally applicable to this situation too.</p>

        <p>Being targeted by harassment is never the fault of the person being harassed. While there is no objectively “right” way to handle harassment, here are some things that might be helpful to you. Take care of your own safety and well-being first.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Consider reaching out to someone (a trusted friend, family member, counselor) who can offer emotional support and constructive advice. These confidantes can provide you with help while you are being subjected to a harassment campaign.</li>


            <li>Consider taking steps to limit people’s effective engagement with you such as turning off open DMs, turning off anonymous questions on curious cat, opt out of notifications on all your affected social media, and turning off replies from people who don’t follow you on Twitter, as well as other precautions in the same vein.</li>


            <li>Mute and block buttons are your friend. Harassers will use a block a point of pride often by posting a picture of the block, but they have no ground to stand on, having harassed you. </li>

            <li>Consider refraining from responding to harassment. While it’s entirely understandable you would seek to defend yourself, should you notice harassment merely persists and increases when you do so, it may be beneficial to disengage. Often when you have come under harassment the stress can cause you to say things you do not believe or are harmful but that you can’t perceive as wrong for whatever reason. You may be may be attacked for poorly worded, or emotionally charged statements. On top of this you’ll have to be accountable for the things you say during this period, which is an additional stressor that you don’t need while you are recovering from a harassment campaign.</li>

            <li>Consider disengaging from social media for a while if your mental health is significantly affected. It’s okay to take breaks when you need it, especially if you find yourself in a harmful situation, it doesn’t make you weak. On the contrary abstaining from social media is a difficult task at the best of times, and doing so while being harassed is significantly moreso.</li>
        </ul>
